Weekly report:
1. 1 page summary - highlights
2. Actions to discussion (Immediate, Mid, Long term)

(29/10/2020)
+ scenario where things go missing (environment - airport, nursing home) - how they address loss items
+ how suppliers - track deliveries


+ physical tag - RFID tag - to locate the physical item in the db
+ RFID tag - explore the costs 

 
+ use case of much scaled down environment - tracking
+ what would be the big picture
+ people's role in the solution - generate the solution - access info in a digestable format

+ what should and more importantly what SHOULDN'T be in it (in the project manual**)

WEDNESDAY evening - mail Padraig (Paw-drich)


* RTLS (Real Time Location Systems) - Technologies that can track location indoors
* Usually has 2 parts: tags and location sensors. Tag (attached to item); Location sensors (fixed beacons within a building). 

(12/11/2020)
+ personal items tracking -such as stethoscope
+ healthcare professionals - helping them track their personal items
+ maybe use ubiquitous WiFi?  
+ if you are going to develop a tech solution - what kind of technology will you deploy to help them
+ cost valuation - lost pen vs lost phone? is the org willing to pay for solution to find a pen or a phone
+ how are people going to access data - database & interface (mobile/web)  
+ what are the tech for tagging & tracking? give reasons for & against **
+ key takeaways of journals ** 

* feasibility of the original proposal

(19/11/2020)
+ value to individual & organisation
+ regardless of context - what are the parts of solution you need to look at?
* store data - perhaps data is stored dynamically - what database?

(THIS WEEK, 26/11/2020)
* communication - with the database
* interface - for the user (web/mobile) - different purposes for mobile and web
* solution for locating large item, indoors
* tagging and tracking - alerts user when they leave the vicinity 
+ low powered technology as a solution
+ mobile app - for field personel to use
+ web app - for admins/supervisors to analyse data
+ Database is centralized -> Relational - structured data a better fit?
# FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS - GPS or Bluetooth? Which is useful in what scenarios?
-> solutions - NFC tagging, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
-> component to make up indoor tracking system - diagram 

(THIS WEEK, 17/12/2020) 
* target client - nursing home staff, enterprise, public
* identify how data is stored - database system
* web app or mobile app? - why?
* ethical consideration - nursing home (24/7  tracking?) when using organization tools - privacy issues
* emotional worth - how much is that item worth? 
* enterprise standpoint - how much is that item worth? 
+ illegal dumping - public sending 
+ work/project plan for January, February, March
-> what are the items that goes missing?  
-> practical consideration - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth range - can it go through walls?
